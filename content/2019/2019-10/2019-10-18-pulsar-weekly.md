## [Pulsar Community Weekly Update] 2019-10-07 ~ 2019-10-18

This is the first Pulsar community weekly update, which helps you quickly capture Pulsar's highlights and spot trends over last week, meanwhile strengthen the communication and connection within the Pulsar family.

### Pulsar Development

- [CI]  ASF Jenkins is still in a flaky state. There is still a huge backlog of pull requests to be merged due to Jenkins issue. Ali Ahmed drove the efforts looking into different CI options to address the problem [1].

- [PIP] [metadata] Matteo proposed introducing pluggable metadata interface in PIP-45 (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-45:-Pluggable-metadata-interface). It is a great movement to support other metadata storage besides zookeeper. The first pull request was merged [2].

- [DOC] [connector] Yu Liu (@Anonymitaet) continues contributing to the documentation for built-in connectors (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5015). Hope we can fill the documentation gap soon. Those changes are available in the latest version of documentation (http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/io-connectors/).

### Ecosystem

- Pulsar + Flink
  
    The discussion of adding Pulsar connector to Flink main repo continues in Flink mailing list. The contributions include Sink Connector, Source Connector and Catalog integration. FLIP-72 is the umbrella for the whole contribution.

- Pulsar + Skywalking
  
    The integration of Pulsar and Skywalking was completed [3]. The Pulsar plugin is now available in Skywalking main repo and will be released in its 6.5.0 release. Kudos to Penghui and the Skywalking community. Penghui also wrote a tutorial about using Skywalking to trace Pulsar messages [4].
