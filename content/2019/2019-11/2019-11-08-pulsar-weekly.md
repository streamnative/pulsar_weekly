## [Pulsar Community Weekly Update] 2019-11-02 ~ 2019-11-08

This is the Pulsar community weekly update for 2019-11-02 ~ 2019-11-08, with updates on the sticky consumer for key-shared subscription, producers support producing messages with different schemas, the release of BookKeeper 4.10, and more.

### Pulsar Development

- [PIP-49][Permissions] The discussion of improvements of permissions continues. The scope of the PIP is proposed to reduce to focus on documenting the permissions for admin API and make the implementation stick to it.

- [PIP-43][Schema] PIP-43 is completed. Producers now are able to send messages with different schemas. Many thanks to Yi Tang for this incredible contribution.

- [PIP-34] Penghui Li introduced sticky consumers for `key_shared` subscription. This provides the ability for implementing an exactly-once source connector for Flink with auto-scaling.
