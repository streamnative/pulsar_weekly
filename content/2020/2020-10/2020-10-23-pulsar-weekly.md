## [Pulsar Community Weekly Update] 2020-10-17 ~ 2020-10-23

This is the Pulsar community weekly update for 2020-10-17 ~ 2020-10-23, with updates on Pulsar client, broker, Pulsar Functions, transaction, tiered storage, and so on.

### Pulsar Highlight

Pulsar supports resetting the cursor to a batch index of the batch message now.

In 2.6.0 release, Pulsar supports acknowledging the batch message index, yet users cannot set the cursor. If users reset the cursor to a batch index of the batch message when consuming messages again, they will get the batch index again.
